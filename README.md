# community

Discussions related to course content will be held in this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/STA518-02-Fall20/community/issues).
Students are welcome and encouraged to post here.
To start a discussion thread, create a new Issue.

Examples of uses for this area are:

- Help with coding
- Installing software
- Other types of computational problems

Some general advice for opening an Issue on GitHub:

- First search existing issues (open and closed) for answers.
  If the question already has been answered, you're done!
  Feel free to open a closed Issue if you believe the answer is not satisfactory.
- Give your Issue an informative title:
  - Good: 'Error: could not find find function "ggplot"'
  - Bad: "I need help!", "Things not working", "aaaaaarrrrrgh!"
    Note that you can edit an Issue's title after it has been posted.
- Format your questions using markdown and code formatting.
  Preview your issue prior to posting.
- Where appropriate, provide links to specific files (or lines within them) or an image/screenshot in the body of your Issue.
  This will help your helper understand your question.
  Note that only I have access to private repos.
- (Optional) Tag someone or a group of people.
  Start by typing the `@` symbol and GitHub will generate some good suggestions.
  To tag me, use `@dykesb`; to tag a class/team mate use their GitHub username.
- Click on **Submit new issue** when you are ready to post.

Don't just create Issues, also respond to them!
Your experience might have some valuable insight to add to the conversation; it doesn't have to be in terms of "correctness".

As Issues get resolved, they will be closed.
So don't forget to look in the [closed Issues](https://github.com/STA518-02-Fall20/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before posting a new one.
You can use the "Search" feature on this repository to find topics.

Here are some GitHub handles that you may find useful.
This will be updated throughout the semester with team handles.
